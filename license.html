Agreement (called the &quot;Agreement&quot;), is a legal agreement between you, either an
individual or an organization or other legal entity, (called &quot;Licensee&quot;) and Jagacy
Software. Your use of Jagacy 3270 or Jagacy VT Software, any updates
received to it, or any related documentation (herein collectively referred to as
&quot;Program&quot;) is subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The term &quot;Program&quot; means the original program and all whole or
partial copies of it, including portions merged into other programs. Jagacy
Software grants you a nonexclusive license for the Program as specified herein.
You agree to ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or
remotely) does so only for your authorized use and complies with the terms of
this Agreement. Jagacy Software will not charge you for the rights granted to

Agreement specifies one of the versions explicitly.<br>
<br>
Jagacy Software grants Licensee one of the following nonexclusive licenses depending on
Licensee's type of use of the Program and the license fee paid. Except for the
licenses marked as free hereafter, a license is not granted if Licensee cannot
prove payment of the corresponding license fee as published by Jagacy Software
at the time of purchase of such license. Implied licenses are negated. <br>
<br>
<b>Evaluation License</b><br>

This free, non-transferable license allows to use the Evaluation Version of the Program during a free evaluation period,
provided the terms of this agreement are met. </p>

for 30 calendar days from the day of first use by Licensee. Licensee can use the

3. Before the end of the 30 day evaluation period, Licensee must either purchase
a paid license to the Program or remove the Program from all the machines where
Licensee installed it. In either case the Evaluation License is terminated.</p>
